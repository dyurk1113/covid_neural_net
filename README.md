## Script Summary:
* **main.py**: Standard entry point. Generates all relevant files and runs the neural network training.
* **gen_data_files.py**: Processes raw data into a training data frame for the neural net
* **run_neural_new.py**: Build, train, and validate the neural net and save results
* **process_results.py**: Process and visualize some aspects of the neural net prediction outputs
* **run_xgboost.py**: Deprecated model architecture that was previously attempted. Still useful as a metric of relative parameter importance
